# Learning game engine  
This is a game engine with its only purpose to help me learn about computers and game engines.  
This application will also serve as testing grounds for the extended universe mod. To create aspects of the mod outside of minecraft in a clean environment and then once finished, implement it.  

## Performance  
This game engine will also be used for performance learning practices. Because I will need to know all about optimizing java code for when I make the ####### 1.12.2 optimized mod loader I can identify issues in the game and fix them efficiently
