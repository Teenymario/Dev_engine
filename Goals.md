# Development goals
- [x] Create a tick system, allow for no framerate cap
- [ ] Create instantiate, pre init, init and post init loading phases
- [ ] Create a class to manage the registering, storing and usage of blocks. Create registry names for blocks.
- [ ] Hardcode predefined block models
- [ ] Create basic resource system (similar to that of minecraft)
- [ ] Create texture atlas
- [ ] Create new rendering pipeline
- [x] Create a simple 16x16x16 chunk of minecraft blocks
- [ ] Chunk rendering optimisations (greedy meshing)
- [ ] Maybe implement full RGB color rendering
- [ ] Introduce prototype terrain generation
- [ ] Terrain gen optimisations
- [ ] Mimic cubic chunks like world
- [ ] Optimised world save format
- [ ] Create a basic loading screen
- [ ] Create a basic ticking system
- [ ] Create a basic modloader for the game using ASM bytecode manipulation
- [ ] Create efficient and optimised modding api that mimics/is similar to that of forge 1.12.2
- [ ] Create a basic mod
- [ ] Use bytecode manipulation from the modding api to manipulate and rewrite code within the game
- [ ] Modify a mod using another mod

After this we tackle the ####### optimised 1.12.2 mod loader
