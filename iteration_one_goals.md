# Development goals
These are the development goals that the first iteration of the game engine had achieved before I broke it and decided that it is better to restart from scratch rather than rewrite the same codebase for the 3rd time
- [x] Create a tick system, allow for no framerate cap
- [x] Create instantiate, pre init, init and post init loading phases
- [x] Create a class to manage the registering, storing and usage of blocks. Create registry names for blocks.
- [x] Create basic resource system (similar to that of minecraft)
- [x] Create texture atlas
- [x] Create new rendering pipeline
- [x] Create a simple 16x16x16 chunk of minecraft blocks
- [x] Create a culled chunk mesher
- [x] Implement multithreading
- [ ] Optimise via single world mesh
- [ ] Make a GUI system
- [ ] Chunk rendering optimisations (greedy meshing)
- [ ] Maybe implement full RGB color rendering
- [x] Introduce prototype terrain generation
- [ ] Terrain gen optimisations
- [x] Mimic cubic chunks like world
- [ ] Optimised world save format
- [ ] Create a basic loading screen
- [ ] Create a basic ticking system
- [ ] Create a basic modloader for the game using ASM bytecode manipulation
- [ ] Create efficient and optimised modding api that mimics/is similar to that of forge 1.12.2
- [ ] Create a basic mod
- [ ] Use bytecode manipulation from the modding api to manipulate and rewrite code within the game
- [ ] Modify a mod using another mod
